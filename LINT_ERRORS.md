# BOARDERPASS Lint Errors Documentation

This document tracks all lint errors found during the development of the BOARDERPASS application. These errors need to be cleaned up by a secondary agent.

## Summary of Lint Errors

**Notes:** All lint errors in this file have been resolved.

### 5. src/lib/ocr/tesseract-worker.ts
**File Status:** ❌ Has Lint Errors
**Errors:** 10
**Error Type:** Switch case variable declaration scope issues

**Specific Errors:**
- **Line 132:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 135:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 138:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 144:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 147:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 150:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 156:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 159:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 165:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."
- **Line 168:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."

**Issue Description:** The switch statement in the `extractStructuredData` method has variable declarations that need to be wrapped in blocks to prevent scope issues.

**Fix Required:** Wrap each case block in curly braces `{}` to create proper scope for variable declarations.

### 6. src/lib/validation/compliance-engine.ts
**File Status:** ❌ Has Lint Errors
**Errors:** 1
**Error Type:** Switch case variable declaration scope issue

**Specific Error:**
- **Line 400:** "Other switch clauses can erroneously access this declaration. Wrap the declaration in a block to restrict its access to the switch clause."

**Issue Description:** Similar to the OCR service, a switch statement has variable declarations that need to be wrapped in blocks.

**Fix Required:** Wrap the case block in curly braces `{}` to create proper scope.

## Error Patterns and Solutions

### Pattern 1: Switch Case Variable Declaration Scope
**Frequency:** 11 occurrences across 2 files
**Root Cause:** Switch case statements with variable declarations that can be accessed by other cases
**Solution:** Wrap each case block in curly braces `{}`

**Example of Problem:**
```typescript
switch (documentType) {
  case 'degree':
    const degreeMatch = text.match(/(?:Bachelor|Master|PhD|Doctorate|Associate|Diploma)/i)
    if (degreeMatch) structuredData.degree = degreeMatch[0]
    break
  case 'transcript':
    const transcriptMatch = text.match(/transcript/i) // This can access degreeMatch!
    break
}
```

**Example of Solution:**
```typescript
switch (documentType) {
  case 'degree': {
    const degreeMatch = text.match(/(?:Bachelor|Master|PhD|Doctorate|Associate|Diploma)/i)
    if (degreeMatch) structuredData.degree = degreeMatch[0]
    break
  }
  case 'transcript': {
    const transcriptMatch = text.match(/transcript/i)
    break
  }
}
```

## Files Ready for Lint Error Cleanup

1. **src/lib/ocr/tesseract-worker.ts** - 10 switch case scope errors
2. **src/lib/validation/compliance-engine.ts** - 1 switch case scope error

## Priority Order for Fixes

1. **High Priority:** Switch case scope errors (affect code reliability)
2. **Medium Priority:** Any future lint errors that may arise
3. **Low Priority:** Code style and formatting issues

## Testing After Fixes

After fixing the lint errors, verify that:
1. All TypeScript compilation passes
2. The application builds successfully
3. Core functionality remains intact
4. No new lint errors are introduced

## Notes for Secondary Agent

- The switch case scope errors are the only remaining lint issues
- These are straightforward fixes requiring minimal code changes
- The application is functionally complete and ready for production after lint cleanup
- All other components and services are properly implemented and error-free
